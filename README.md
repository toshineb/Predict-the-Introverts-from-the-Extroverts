# Predicting Introverts from Extroverts Using AutoGluon

## Overview

This project demonstrates the power of **AutoGluon**, a cutting-edge AutoML library developed by AWS, to predict personality types—specifically, distinguishing between **Introverts** and **Extroverts** based on behavioral and demographic data. As a data analyst and scientist with a focus on human-centered AI, I explored how machine learning can be used to reveal psychological traits from structured datasets.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Build a high-performance binary classification model with minimal code using `AutoGluon`.
- Investigate psychological features that influence introversion vs. extroversion tendencies.
- Compare the AutoML approach against traditional methods for speed, accuracy, and deployment readiness.
- Demonstrate the applicability of ML in behavioral analytics for HR tech, ed-tech, and digital well-being tools.

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters

Understanding personality traits from data has wide-reaching implications:
- In **recruitment**, it enables data-driven candidate profiling.
- In **education**, it can personalize learning approaches.
- In **mental health**, it offers scalable tools for early screening.

By leveraging **AutoGluon's** AutoML capabilities, we significantly reduce the time-to-model, making advanced analytics accessible to non-experts while maintaining accuracy.

## 📈 Key Outcomes

- Achieved high classification accuracy with minimal hyperparameter tuning.
- AutoGluon ranked top-performing models based on real-time leaderboard scores.
- Developed an interpretable pipeline that can be extended for multi-class psychological profiling.

## 📌 Future Work

- Deploy model as an interactive web app using **Streamlit** or **Gradio**.
- Extend to multi-label classification (e.g., Big Five personality traits).
- Integrate with surveys or wearable device data for richer feature engineering.
